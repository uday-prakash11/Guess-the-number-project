# Guess-the-number-Project
A "Guess the Number" project in Python involves creating a game where the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it. The computer provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Here’s a summary of how to build this project:


Key Components

1.Random Number Generation:

Use Python’s random module to generate a random number within a specified range.

2.User Input:

Use the input function to get guesses from the player.

3.Feedback Mechanism:

Compare the player’s guess to the randomly generated number and provide feedback.

4.Game Loop:

Repeat the guessing process until the player guesses correctly or chooses to quit.
